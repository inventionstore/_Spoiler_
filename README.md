In the year 2000, I began the Web Development and Business Programming

course at The Chubb Institute. It was a 9 month program, a kind of

bootcamp from before a time most people had heard of such a concept.

 

We learned the basics of what would become web 2.0, as well as

Oracle SQL, MicroSoft Access, Visual Basic, and Java Servlets and

Applets. We built all our programs in Text Edit.

 

In black and white text just like you see on this page!

 

/* and one of the most important tools I learned at that time was

    using pseudocode and writing good comments */

 

After finishing the program I followed along with the world of web

development, worked with many startups, relearned the standards

consitently, learned from new developers who learned programming in 

a very different way than I had. And, I dove deep into all the current tools

available to developers at the current moments in time.

 

I'll admit that at times I feel left behind. It's hard to keep up with all the

latest frameworks, tooling, and paradigms. But, I've often found that brand

new developers learn the skills they are taught by sheer enthusiasm and

dedication. And, old developers can relearn new skills in much the same

way but through a different context. A different lens. 

 

What we as developers and innovators all have in common is a need to

communicate and facilitate a structure to nurture our visions.
