S.I.S.T.E.R. License
(Spoiler Invention Store Technological Equity Reserve)

The goal of this license is to allow for open source projects to maintain
a structure of equity amongst contributors and/or stakeholders as defined
and allow for permitable use of the underlying software and logic as a tool,
where permitable through the adaptable license by assignment of the
adapted license; but not to allow redistribution of the underlying 
software and/or logic which the license precludes.
